/*
In the above program, the NetworkDevice interface represents the responsibility of connecting to
and disconnecting from a network, while the PrinterDevice interface represents the responsibility
of connecting to a printer, disconnecting from a printer, and printing a document. The Computer
class implements both interfaces, adhering to the Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) by
implementing only the methods relevant to its specific responsibilities.
